* GitIssius

** About

GitIssius is an issue tracker intergrated in your git repository. In
other words a distributed bug tracker.

*** Why bother?

Your code lives in your git repo. Your documentation lives in your git
repo. Why aren't your bugs in your git repo?

Git provides a really great version control system. Unlike other
systems though it does not provide any functionality related to
issue / bug tracking. You have to rely on 3rd party systems like
[[http://www.bugzilla.org][Bugzilla]] or GitHub issue tracker to track your bugs.

This is fundamentally wrong!

 - Because you quit your programming enviroment to visit webpages to add
   / view bugs.

 - Because the bugs are not stored in the same place as your code
   and / or documentation.

 - Because you cannot edit / view your bugs offline.

*GitIssius comes in action*

GitIssius stores your bugs in the same repo where your code lives. It
creates another branch named 'gitissius' which you don't have to
checkout ever. Provides a git command named 'issius' to control you
issues.

It was inspired by other distributed bug tracking systems like [[http://fossil-scm.org/][Fossil]],
[[http://bugseverywhere.org/][BugsEverywhere]] and [[http://ditz.rubyforge.org/][Ditz]]. Started as a fork of [[https://github.com/jwiegley/git-issues][git-issues]] but then
realized that I wanted a completelly different code base, so I wrote
most things from scratch.

*** Tips and tricks
 - Use 'TAB' for completion in fields.
 - Install 'colorama' package for colors
 - Sorting and Filtering actions can refer to the following fields:
   assigned_to, created_on, updated_to, reported_from, status, id,
   title
 - Filtering supports '__not', '__exact' and '__startswith' on text
   properties.
